 Here's a glimpse of the projects I've contributed to:

Hate Speech Detection:

Description: Implemented a robust hate speech detection model using machine learning techniques. The project involved extensive text processing, feature engineering, and the training of a model capable of identifying and flagging hate speech in textual data.

Spam SMS Classification:

Description: Developed a spam SMS classification system using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. The model efficiently distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages, providing a practical solution for SMS filtering.

Credit Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Description: Conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a credit dataset. Explored patterns, relationships, and statistical insights to inform credit risk assessments. The project involved data visualization, feature engineering, and statistical analysis.
